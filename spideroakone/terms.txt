SpiderOak ONE Service Agreement
NOTE: This document represents an exact copy of the SERVICE AGREEMENT as it appears when you download the SpiderOak application. It is posted here as a reference and/or for your review prior to accepting the terms of the SERVICE AGREEMENT.

This Services Agreement ("Agreement") governs the provision by SpiderOak, Inc. ("SpiderOak") and the access and use by you, its customer ("you" or "Customer") of SpiderOak's data storage services ("Services"). BY CLICKING ON "I ACCEPT" BELOW OR OTHERWISE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE HAVING REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU SHOULD NOT BEGIN USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT OR SPIDEROAK'S SERVICES, AND YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY SPIDEROAK.

Services
You will be required to download the SpiderOak software onto your computer and select the data you wish to backup ("Selected Data"); thereafter, the SpiderOak software will automatically backup any revisions or modifications that you make to the Selected Data given the application is running. Once the Selected Data is backed up you will be able to access and share your personal Selected Data as discussed more fully below. Additionally, you may add any number of computers to your SpiderOak Network providing a secure central location to store all of your data.

SpiderOak offers two levels of Services:
(i) SpiderOak Free and (ii) SpiderOak Plus. The SpiderOak Free service provides customers with a limited amount of storage space as specified at https://spideroak.com/solutions/spideroakone. You may upgrade to the SpiderOak Plus service which provides Customers with an increased amount of storage space for a monthly fee at the rate currently listed on the SpiderOak website https://spideroak.com/solutions/spideroakone. The Selected Data is stored redundantly; however, in rare instances you may not be able to gain access to your Selected Data during scheduled maintenance or other force majeure occurrences.

Data Protection and Encryption.
SpiderOak understands the critical importance of security and privacy and has taken extraordinary measures to protect your Selected Data. When you register for the Services you will choose a personal login ("Username") and private encrypted password ("Password") Your Username and Password are required to access your Selected in a readable format. Further, to ensure complete privacy and security, your Password is NEVER stored or known by SpiderOak. Thus, it is extremely important to remember your Password as SpiderOak will not be able to reset your Password or provide access to your Selected Data should you forget it. You may change your password at any time by opening the 'ACCOUNT' page in the application. Upon registration, you will also be prompted to create an optional password hint ("Password Hint"). The Password Hint is designed to provide you with enough information to recall your password should you forget it. SpiderOak will store the Password Hint encrypted and only provide it back to the e-mail address entered on your account at the time of registration. You can retrieve your Password Hint anytime on the SpiderOak website by clicking on the link "FORGOT YOUR PASSWORD?".

Sharing of Selected Data.
As part of the functionality of our Services, you will be able to share your Selected Data with others ("Sharing Function") subject to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree and understand that the Sharing Function is meant for your personal use only and is not intended for widespread dissemination of your Selected Data. SpiderOak reserves the right to monitor general system usage and performance to identify excessive use of the Sharing Function. The Sharing Function may be deemed excessive if the network traffic greatly exceeds the average usage of the services by customers generally. This safeguard is in place to protect against egregious use of SpiderOak ShareRooms as massive content distribution channels.

Terms of Service.
You agree that SpiderOak reserves the right in its sole discretion to establish general operating practices and procedures to maximize the operation and availability of the Services for the greatest benefit of its customers.

If, in using the SpiderOak Free service you are deemed to have violated the policies set forth in this Agreement, SpiderOak reserves the right to freeze, cancel and/or purge your account with or without notice. By registering for the SpiderOak Free Service, you acknowledge and agree that your Selected Data may not be available at certain intervals in order for SpiderOak to perform performance maintenance on its servers, or other reasons beyond the control of SpiderOak.

You may at any point upgrade to the SpiderOak Plus Service. If, in using the SpiderOak Plus service you are deemed to have violated the policies set forth above in this Agreement, SpiderOak reserves the right to freeze your account immediately, and shall provide you with written notice via email of your violation so that you may respond to such determination within thirty (30) days. If no response is received by SpiderOak within thirty (30) days of sending you notice of the violation, SpiderOak reserves the right to cancel your membership. Upon deciding to cancel your membership pursuant to this Section, SpiderOak shall provide you with written notice via email of such cancellation and shall continue to store your Selected Data for a period of sixty (60) days from the date notice of cancellation is sent, after which time your Selected Data shall be purged from the system.

Where appropriate, SpiderOak may suspend repeat infringers of copyright law, and in more serious cases, permanently terminate user accounts.

Registration.
In order to access the Service, you must complete the registration process and obtain your personal Email/Username and Password. In connection with your registration, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form; and (b) maintain and promptly update such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. In addition, you may only register for one SpiderOak Free account. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if you register for more than one SpiderOak Free account, SpiderOak has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current and future use of the Services. In addition, SpiderOak reserves the right to deny registration to any customer it deems inappropriate to use the Services. You may not register for the Service if you are under 14 years of age. By registering for the Services, you represent to SpiderOak that you are 14 years of age or older, and hereby agree to be legally bound by this Agreement (or, if you are under the age of majority in your state (usually 18), you represent that your parent or legal guardian is hereby agreeing on your behalf to be legally bound by this Agreement).

You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your Email/Username and Password and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses, you or SpiderOak may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your Email/Username and Password, including any charges for additional storage space, etc., or other charges associated with your account, and for ensuring that use of your account complies fully with this Agreement. You agree to immediately notify SpiderOak of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. You may not use anyone else's account, at any time, without the permission of the account holder.

Payment; Renewal Notices.
To the extent applicable, all payments shall be made in US dollars by credit card and are non-refundable. Payments are due upon account activation and future renewal dates. Services will not be activated until payment is received. Service for any renewal period will not be provided unless and until SpiderOak has received payment for such renewal period. Renewal payments shall be automatically charged to your credit card and your account shall automatically renew unless you provide SpiderOak with notice of termination pursuant to the terms set forth below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should payment in full of any amount owed to SpiderOak under this Agreement not be received by SpiderOak within thirty (30) days after such payment has become due, such amounts will thereafter bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less. If any payment due SpiderOak is collected at law or through an attorney at law or under advice therefrom or through a collection agency, you agree to pay all costs of collection, including, without limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. Access and use of SpiderOak Free is provided, in part, to allow you an opportunity to use the Service on a trial basis before signing up for SpiderOak Plus and making payment.
